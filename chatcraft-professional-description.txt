Relationship to ChatCraft
-------------------------
ChatCraft Professional is a standalone product, separate from ChatCraft (the customer engagement chatbot platform). While both products leverage AI and document processing, they serve fundamentally different use cases:

- ChatCraft: Customer-facing chatbots for businesses (B2B2C)
- ChatCraft Professional: Internal document intelligence for professionals (B2B)

The products share branding lineage but have separate codebases, infrastructure, and go-to-market strategies.
